How to Run:
 - Using ThreadPool:
 1. Go to server.cpp, make sure the global variable is set to 1.  
   -> #define THREAD_POOL 1 and save it.

 - Using Multi Thread:
 1. Go to server.cpp, make sure the global variable is set to 0.  
   -> #define THREAD_POOL 0 and save it. 
 
 2. For server side, you can change # of cores of CPU in testserver.sh in src directory:
   $ taskset --cpu-list 0 ./server  //running 1 core
   $ taskset --cpu-list 0-1 ./server  //running 2 core
   $ taskset --cpu-list 0-3 ./server  //running 4 core

 3. For client side:
   - You can directly run script by:
      $ chmod u+r+x testclient.sh
      $ ./testclient.sh
   // Changing threads number can be easily modified in testclient.sh
   - Or you can test .xml separately by:
      single-thread: $ ./client example.xml
      multi-thread:  $ ./client example.xml #ofThreads
